<h2>Processing Art</h2>
<h3>Title: JavaScript Shapes</h3>

<p>
I had a bit of difficulty learning how to use the program Processing, but after a few tries, I was able to play around with its functions. I decided to stick with my comforts for this static piece and just make shapes. I played with the locations of the shapes but mostly wanted to focus on the color and aesthetic of the art. Overall, it was a good experience learning how to use this program.

<h3>Title: JavaScript Interactive</h3>

To create an interactive piece on processing, I did not have a particular idea of design in mind. I liked the idea of moving the mouse to change the appearance of the work, so with that I worked with colors to express a theme. I added a chevron pattern near the top, as well as an appearing and disappering ellipse to add some more flare. Overall while it is on the simplier side, the themes of colors is what I tried to focus on.
