I wanted to create a virtual world that had a clear contrast between a space-like, metallic and futuristic perception of the world with aspects of nature intertwined within it. The human head morphed into the planet Earth, is to represent the astounding impact that humans have had on the developing world. The head creates an earie vibe as it always has its eyes on the viewer. The other aspects of nature are glossed over with this sort of metallic paint, with a reflection of the galaxy, almost to comment on how we as a civilization, have moved on from trying to fix our own world, such as global warming, and how we are now looking to space for more places to move. Essentially this glossing over is to represent how we are not fixing the issues in our world but rather painting over them in the hopes that the issues will solve themselves. In the virtual reality experience, the viewer sees the landscape as if they are small, almost to the ratio of bug-sized, only adding to the commentary that humans are in fact just small gears in the machine that is life on planet Earth and how our egos are typically too large, as if we are larger than life. There are no specific artistic influences for this piece.

Using the ios application Qlone, on my smartphone, I was able to clone a pen into a 3D image directly onto my iPhone. Using the effects in Sketchfab, I was able to distort and manipulate the 3D image to create this virtual effect.
